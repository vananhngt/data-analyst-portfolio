# Data Analyst Portfolio: Van Anh Nguyenova

Hi, I’m Van Anh! I’m currently completing my MSc in Business Analytics at Imperial College London. I love using data to uncover insights, solve real-world problems, and turn messy datasets into clear, meaningful stories.

Ever since elementary school, I’ve had a natural interest in numbers. During my undergraduate studies, I especially enjoyed modules like Statistics and Econometrics — which led me to pursue a master’s focused on data science. Over the past year, I’ve gained hands-on experience in machine learning, optimization, decision modeling, and causal inference techniques. Now, I’m eager and driven to apply these skills in a data analyst or data specialist role.

I’m a curious and determined person, quick to learn and passionate about continuous growth. Whatever I commit to, I follow through with dedication and focus. I hope this portfolio reflects some of that energy — it showcases selected projects from my master’s studies and tracks my progress across data analytics and data science topics.
