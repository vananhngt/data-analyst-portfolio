# Data Analyst Portfolio: Van Anh Nguyenova

## About

Hi, I’m Van Anh! I’m currently completing my MSc in Business Analytics at Imperial College London. I love using data to uncover insights, solve real-world problems, and turn messy datasets into clear, meaningful stories.

Ever since elementary school, I’ve had a natural interest in numbers. During my undergraduate studies, I especially enjoyed modules like Statistics and Econometrics, which led me to pursue a master’s focused on data science. Over the past year, I’ve gained hands-on experience in machine learning, optimization, decision modeling, and causal inference techniques. Now, I’m eager and driven to apply these skills in a data analyst or data specialist role.

I’m a curious and determined person, quick to learn and passionate about continuous growth. Whatever I commit to, I follow through with dedication and focus. I hope this portfolio reflects some of that energy and passion: it showcases selected projects from my master’s studies and tracks my progress across data analytics and data science topics.

## Portfolio Projects

### Python

#### Organizational Communication Network Analysis

- **Goal:**  To identify leaders and opinion-makers in a student cohort based on their email communication data.

- **Description:**  Based on email exchange data, two directed networks were constructed — one representing messages sent and the other representing messages received. The analysis aimed to distinguish individuals who actively initiate communication (opinion-makers) from those who are frequently contacted (leaders), while also uncovering deeper structural insights into the cohort’s communication dynamics.

- **Skills / Tools Used:**  Python (NetworkX, pandas), graph construction, centrality metrics (degree, eigenvector, betweenness, closeness), clustering coefficient, data cleaning 

- **Results & Insights:**  The analysis identified individuals who actively initiated conversations, as well as those frequently sought out and trusted by others. A key individual was found to serve as a connector between two distinct clusters, highlighting a bridging role across subgroups. Overall, the communication structure appeared decentralized, with influence distributed among multiple prominent figures rather than concentrated in a single leader.

- **Deliverables:**
